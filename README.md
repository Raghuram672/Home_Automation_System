# Home Automation System

A **Home Automation System** project built with **C/C++** on **Arduino Uno**. This system automates several household functionalities, including **light control using LDR**, **temperature monitoring**, and **water tank management**. It is designed to improve energy efficiency and convenience in home management through automated sensors and control mechanisms.

## Features
- **LDR-based Light Control**: Automatically turns lights on or off based on ambient light levels.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Displays current temperature and activates a cooling system (e.g., fan) when temperature exceeds a set threshold.
- **Water Tank Management**: Monitors water levels and controls the pump to fill or stop based on defined tank levels.
- **Arduino Uno Compatibility**: Can be run on real hardware or simulated using Arduino IDE simulators.
